Here are all the different versions of our documentation and our application. We started doing this during release 1.4.1 so there was a time when no documentation existed on github pages. We suggest people upgrading to at least 1.4.0.

+ [latest](http://uw-madison-doit.github.io/uw-frame/latest/)

+ [1.4.0](http://uw-madison-doit.github.io/uw-frame/1.4.0/)
